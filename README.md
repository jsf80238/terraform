# terraform

Shows my (very) basic understanding. I followed the Google tutorial and made the following changes:
- Changed the VM type from `f1-micro` to `e2-micro`.
  - `f1-micro` would probably have been fine but Google explicitly says `e2-micro` is on their "free" tier.
- Added the `project` name where required (seems to be a bug in Google's documentation).

The results can be viewed at http://35.199.167.63:5000/.
